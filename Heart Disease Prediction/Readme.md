# Heart Disease Prediction
<b>This code performs the following tasks:

1. Loads the heart disease dataset and prints the columns.
2. Splits the dataset into features (X) and target variable (y).
3. Splits the data into training and testing sets.
4. Trains three different models <b>(Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gaussian Naive Bayes)</b> on the training data.
5. Prints the accuracy of each model on the test data.
6. Identifies the best model based on accuracy and prints the result.

# Final Results:<b>
## 1. Logistic Regression
    with accuracy: 85.0%
## 2. Random Forest Model
   with accuracy: 88.52%
## 3. Gaussian Naive Bayes
   with Accuracy: 85.25% </b>

# The best model with accuracy is Random Forest Model with 88.52%
