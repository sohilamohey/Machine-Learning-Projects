This project focuses on classifying heart disease using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. Below are the key techniques applied:

- **OneHotEncoder:** 
- **LabelEncoder:** 
- **Outlier Removal:** 
Outliers were identified and removed from the dataset to improve model performance.
- **SVM Model:** 
Created and trained to classify heart disease based on input features.

The model achieved an accuracy of 88%.
