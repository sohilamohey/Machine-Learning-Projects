 Performed necessary data cleaning steps to prepare the dataset for modeling.

#### 2. Scaling:
Robust Scaler: Used to normalize the range of independent variables, making the scaling process robust to outliers.
#### 3. Data Visualization: 
Created visualizations to understand the data distribution and identify patterns.

#### 4. Model Training:
<b>
Logistic Regression: Achieved 90.24% accuracy.
Random Forest: Achieved 90.24% accuracy.
Gradient Boosting: Achieved 93.50% accuracy.
Support Vector Machine: Achieved 93.50% accuracy.
Model Fine-Tuning: Fine-tuned each model to optimize their performance.

#### 5. Model Selection:
Chose Gradient Boosting as the best model based on its performance, achieving an accuracy of 93.50%.
